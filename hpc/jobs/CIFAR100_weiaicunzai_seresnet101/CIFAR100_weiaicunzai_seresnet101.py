The code in this script is stolen from the following GitHub link:
https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100

It seems to work adequately in regards to what we want to achieve and as

I will in this script try to implement the seresnet101 which achieved a:
TOP1 error of 20.98, and a
TOP5 error of 5.41.
